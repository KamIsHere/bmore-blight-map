### Fight Blight Bmore | Data Dashboard
---

Fight Blight Bmore is an economic, environmental, and social justice initiative led by the community and informed by data to address the issue of blight, led by the community and informed by data. Fight Blight Bmore has two functions:

- To inform individuals about blight and its impact; and
- To create a mobile application to identify, report, and analyze blight data.

The application will give users guidance on identifying blight and provide information on how blight impacts quality of life and community wellness. Additionally, the mobile system will provide an easy-to-use method to document blighted conditions. After the user documents blight, the mobile system will automatically report conditions to the appropriate parties. The application also will allow users to view and use a variety of analytic tools, as well as follow and update reports of blight.

For Hack for Impact we contacted Nneka and asked her how we might further her work! She said:

> "To answer your re-question the hack for social impact you all could create to extend Fight Blight Bmore's work, is a web based dashboard with blight heat maps where users can add data layers such as vacant house notices, property condemnations, liquor stores density, construction permits, corner stores licenses, lead paint notices, etc. These types of data visualization as sorely lacking."

We referenced [Baltimore City open data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/) to create a d3.js dashboard that lets anyone explore the data. We believe that this will help community members better understand the problem and draw their own conclusions. Fight Blight will soon be launching a beta version of their application. We will work with Nneka and her team to integrate this map with her platform and add additional functionality like the ability to upload pictures of blight and hazards to the map.

Knowledge is power, and we believe that the power to advocate for a healthier Baltimore should be in the hands of the community.
